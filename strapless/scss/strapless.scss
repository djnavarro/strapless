// strapless is a subset of bootstrap 4.6 designed to
// support the bs4cards package: it imports the bootstrap
// grid, the cards system, and styling related to images.
// as much as possible it avoids incorporating typography
// or other features that might conflict with the visual
// style of a distill site.
