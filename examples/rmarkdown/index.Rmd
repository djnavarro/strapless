```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's type some code

```{r}
library(bs4cards)
my_cards <- list(
  sample_card(margin = bs_mar(1)), 
  sample_card(margin = bs_mar(1)), 
  sample_card(margin = bs_mar(0)), 
  sample_card(margin = bs_mar(0)), 
  sample_card(margin = bs_mar(0))
)
```

Type some more, and out should come the grid:

```{r}
card_grid(my_cards)
```
